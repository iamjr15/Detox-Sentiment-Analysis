# Detox-Sentiment-analysis

[Python, Tweepy Library, Twitter API, Scikit-learn, Numpy, Pandas] 

Building a python application for classification and seggregation of data as a racist/sexist comment or not - 

1. Gathering and cleaning : Scraped data from twitter using tweepy library in Python, which communicates with the twitter API and built functions to clean, parse and tokenize the tweets.
2. Visualization and Extraction : Cleaned data is visualized in WordCloud format and extracted features for the same using natural language processing.
3. Classification : Built a Na√Øve Bayes classifier from the scikit-learn library to detect the nature of tweets from the set of features extracted in Python.

[For training dataset I have used Analytics Vidhya twitter dataset which contains labeled 31962 tweets. Also, built a classifier using linear SVC]
